    <p>Homemade Homestead LLC was officially founded in March 2024 with a simple goal: to be a recognized, trusted name in our community—one rooted in authenticity, quality, and care.</p>

    <p>While we both work full-time jobs, we dedicate the rest of our energy to building a life centered on sustainability, craftsmanship, and community connection. Every day begins with tending to our animals, and every spare moment goes into cultivating, crafting, and caring.</p>

    <p>We raise dairy goats and chickens, and use their milk and eggs in our handmade soaps and baked goods. From our farmstand and at craft fairs, we offer seasonal produce like blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, apples, peaches, pears, plums, cherries, squash, tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers—alongside fabric goods like tote bags, backpacks, travel bags, and more.</p>

    <p>At Homemade Homestead, we’re committed to excellence. Whether it’s a jar of jam or a handmade bag, our goal is to deliver something real—something made with care, intention, and joy. We want you to feel the love behind everything we offer.</p>

    <p>We’re still working on our official bios, but someday soon we’d like to share more about who we are and why we do what we do. And yes—expect a rotating “Employee of the Week” feature starring Bruno the dog and the rest of our very expressive animals.</p>
